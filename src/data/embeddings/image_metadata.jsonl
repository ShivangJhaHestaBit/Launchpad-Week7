Our strong and growing data assets from\nmore than 30,000 connected vehicles, combined with the\nunique proprietary knowledge and insights derived from decades\nof patrol knowledge and customer proximity gives us some\nunrivalled advantages in this important and fast-moving\nmobility ecosystem.\n\nIn addition to the connected car agenda, increasing expertise and\ncapability in the electrification arena plays an important role in\nour Horizon 2 strategy. Key priorities include further equipping\nand training our patrols to deal with EV specific issues and\ninvestment in mobile charging and other solutions to address\n‘range anxiety’. Beyond this we will continue to enhance the\nwider AA EV offering significantly to ensure the AA remains the\ngo-to provider for future drivers. In short, ensuring that the EV\ndrivers’ needs, and indeed all drivers’ needs, can be entirely\nmet by the AA.\n\n8 AALimited Annual Report and Accounts 2022\n\nOur impact matters, and our Environmental, Social and\nGovernance (ESG) activities are an important part of our\nbusiness. We have included in our reporting our key\nenvironmental, social and corporate governance updates.\nHowever, this is just a small part of a what we do and we will\nbe launching a separate ESG report in the coming months to\ntalk about our ESG activities to date, and our commitments\nfor the future.\n\nHorizon 3: Monetising innovation\n\nAs we move to Horizon 3, we will capitalise on new opportunities\nin the automotive value chain, extend our leadership in\nelectrification and develop wider ecosystem propositions.\n\nThe unique combination of an iconic, trusted brand, scale in\nterms of customer reach and data and the breadth of the AA’s\npropositional offer gives rise to unrivalled opportunities for\n\nnew and more integrated customer propositions. Over the next\n18-24 months we will develop more detailed strategies, business\nmodels and further partnerships to modernise the AA and\ndevelop new revenue streams and future growth.\n\n2021 has been a challenging\nyet rewarding and promising\nyear for the AA - thank you\n\nto all of our teams for their\ndedication this year.

In\naddition, we introduced a new leadership capability framework and 360 feedback process.\n\nOur people accessed over 100,000 hours of learning in 2021/22, equating to over two days of learning per person.

We also\nintroduced a new apprenticeship programme to develop HGV drivers. The AA has 205 apprentices and we use apprenticeships to\nprovide professional development to our existing people. Over 70% of our apprentices are internal and we provide entry level to\npost-graduate level qualifications. We also have gender diverse apprentices with almost an equal split of males and females.\n\nAttracting Talent\n\nIn an increasingly tough talent market, we have continued to attract great talent to the AA. For example, by introducing remote\nworking to attract diverse and geographically dispersed talent.

The proceeds enabled the\ncontinued global expansion of sales and marketing\ninvestments, continued development of strategic\nalliances with the likes of Microsoft, Thales and KPMG\nand assisted in the development and readiness of\nKojensi to enter international markets. In addition to\nAustralian investors, the raise also saw several\nUS-based institutions enter the Company’s register.\n\nCOMMENCED TRADING ON THE\nOTCQB MARKET IN THE UNITED STATES\n\narchTIS successfully commenced trading on the U.S.-\nbased OTCQB Market as announced on 2 November\n2021 under the stock ticker OTCQB: ARHLF.

The Company is providing\nrevenue outlook guidance for a minimum year-on-year\nincrease of 60% with current visibility for triple-digit\ngrowth in FY23. This includes committed revenue\nassociated with the Defence contract, existing short-\nterm deferred revenue on the balance sheet and\npreviously committed contractual engagements.\n\nCore gross margins are anticipated to remain at the\ntargeted 70% level. FY23 cash receipts (without further\nnew sales) are expected to be a minimum of $9.5M.\nThe Company also expects to see its monthly cash\nburn halved, during FY23, due to increased revenues,\ncash receipts and continued monitoring of operating\nexpenses. This will support the trend toward\ncash-flow neutrality.\n\n|\nMatthew Littleton\n\nGovernment t Security Specialist, Microsoft\na4 | |\n\nTim Morrow |\nSituational Awareness Technical \"4\nManager, CERT Division, Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity Software Engineering Institute\nJohn Toomer = i \" |\nDirector of Intelligence, Information and\n\nCyber Systems, Boeing |\n\nie\nJohn Weiler", "caption": "a flyer for the annual meeting of the american association"}

Further information on diversity\nand gender pay can be found in the Strategic\n\nprogress section.\n\nFinally, | would like to take this opportunity to thank all\nof our stakeholders for their support during this year.\n\n|, along with the Board, am available to respond to any\nquestions on this report or any of our activities both\nnow and at the 2023 Annual General Meeting.\n\nJames Bilefield\nChair\n\nAnnual Report and Accounts 2022 P-121", "caption": "a man in a suit and tie standing next to a black background"}

Technology was up 18%\nwith higher demand for roles within infrastructure,\nCyber Security, Open-Source Software Development\nand Leadership and Strategic positions. Engineering\nwas up 27% due to demand for Construction roles.\n\nSwitzerland and Austria also grew strongly up 37%\nand 51% YoY respectively, both driven by the\nTechnology sector.\n\nOutlook\n\nDespite the macro-economic uncertainties, the\nprospects for the DACH market are very encouraging.\nWe believe that the shortage of skilled workers,\nespecially in STEM professions, will ensure an\nincreasing demand for the talents we place over the\nlong term. As the leading STEM provider in the region,\nwe have an excellent platform to continue to grow,\naddress market demand and create sustainable value\nfor candidates and clients.

Opportunities\nrepresent potential achievements through the pipeline, from an\nearly stage where our scientists work to discover new molecules,\nthrough to ultimately obtaining approvals and getting new\nmedicines to patients. Rewarding success at each stage\nrecognises the importance of creating and maintaining a\nlong-term sustainable pipeline. Stretch of proposed targets is\nreviewed by the Science Committee taking into account factors\nsuch as the expected net present value of the pipeline and the\nanticipated financial contribution it will make, past performance,\nthe external regulatory environment, and internal resourcing\n\nand efficiencies. Targets for realisation of these opportunities\nare ambitious.\n\nProposed targets for the Ambition Zero Carbon measure are\nreviewed and endorsed by the Sustainability Committee.\n\nGrowth and Therapy Area Leadership and Achieve Group\nFinancial Targets metrics align with the Company's Mid-Term\nPlan (MTP), which sets out the financial framework for delivering\nour ambitious strategy over a three-year period. The MTP\nprocess includes detailed business reviews, during which plans\nand efficiencies of each unit are challenged, leading to a\nproposed MTP for the Board to review and challenge. The\nCommittee sets targets based on the Board-approved MTP,\nconsidering consensus expectations, independent analytics\nand anticipated challenges and opportunities. Whilst Total\nRevenue and Core EPS targets are set at budget exchange\nrates at the beginning of the performance period and evaluated\nat those rates at the end of the performance period (so that any\nbeneficial or adverse movements in currency do not impact\nreward outcomes), the Committee also compares targets\nagainst prior plans at constant exchange rates, to ensure that\nnew targets incentivise ambitious levels of growth. This range\nof data is used by the Committee to ensure the stretching\nnature of performance targets is robustly tested. Additionally,\nthe PSP TSR measure is designed to reward strong\nperformance relative to our peers.\n\nThe Committee thoroughly reviews and challenges targets\nproposed by management.\n\nThe Committee is provided with considerable supporting\nmaterial for each metric and receives briefings from senior\nleaders across AstraZeneca. The science measures are\nreviewed and endorsed by the Science Committee, with a focus\non ensuring that the targets will result in long-term sustainable\nvalue creation, and the Committee reviews and approves the full\ncohort of opportunities. The ESG metric within the PSP is aligned\nto our Ambition Zero Carbon goal and reflects the importance\nof eliminating GHG emissions for our Scope 1 and Scope 2\noperations by 2025. The Ambition Zero Carbon metric has been\nreviewed and endorsed by our Sustainability Committee.\n\nCommittee members participate in the full Board discussions\non the strategy, MTP and budget, which form the basis for the\ntargets. The Committee considers how proposed financial\ntargets align with the MTP and budget; prior years’ outcomes\n(in absolute terms and against target); how the ambition has\nchanged from the prior MTP and budget; external guidance\nthe Company has provided or plans to give; consensus from\nexternal financial analysts and factors it may be impacted by;\nand the underlying assumptions. Statistical analysis conducted\nby the Committee's independent adviser is also used to assess\nthe proposals. This includes an assessment of historical levels\nof performance volatility.\n\nAt the end of the period, final performance against each metric\nis assessed. Outcomes are calculated based on performance\nagainst each weighted metric. Each performance measure is\nassessed on a standalone basis, so that underperformance\nagainst one measure cannot be compensated for by\noverperformance against another. Data for the metrics is taken\nfrom the Group's financial reports which are reviewed by the\nAudit Committee and approved by the Board.\n\nThe Science Committee independently considers and informs\nthe Committee whether science achievements represent a fair\nand balanced outcome, reflecting genuine achievements and\npipeline progression. Ambition Zero Carbon outcomes are\nvalidated by the Sustainability Committee. Apart from Cash\nflow, which is set at actual rates of exchange, financial metrics\nare set at budget rates of exchange and evaluated at those\nrates at year end, which means they are not directly comparable\nyear-on-year. The Committee is, however, provided with data to\nallow it to conduct year-on-year analyses.\n\nFor annual bonus, the fairness of the formulaic Group scorecard\noutcome is considered in the context of overall business\nperformance and the experience of shareholders. Such\nconsiderations include TSR performance and each Executive\nDirector's personal impact on the delivery of the strategy, wider\nESG performance and other organisational achievements, such\nas inclusion and diversity targets and the realisation of\ntechnology-based milestones. Each year, there are important\nindividual deliverables beyond the scorecard metrics which are\ntaken into account when determining individual bonuses.\n\nHaving considered the Group scorecard outcome, overall\nbusiness performance, the experience of shareholders and\nindividual performance, as detailed from page 115, the Committee\ncarefully determines a final bonus outcome for each Executive\nDirector that is considered fair and appropriate for the year’s\nperformance, and is in the best interests of shareholders.", "caption": "a diagram of the different types of the project"}

In doing so, we consider whether the Other Information is materially inconsistent with\nthe Financial Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially\nmisstated.\n\nWe are required to report if we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this Other\nInformation, and based on the work we have performed on the Other Information that we obtained\nprior to the date of this Auditor's Report we have nothing to report.\n\nResponsibilities of the Directors for the Financial Report\n\nThe Directors are responsible for:\n\ne preparing the Financial Report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian\nAccounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001;\n\ne implementing necessary internal control to enable the preparation of a Financial Report that\ngives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or\nerror; and\n\ne assessing the Group and Company's ability to continue as a going concern and whether the\nuse of the going concern basis of accounting is appropriate. This includes disclosing, as\napplicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting\nunless they either intend to liquidate the Group and Company or to cease operations, or have\nno realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nAuditor's responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report\n\nOur objective is:\n\ne to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Report as a whole is free from\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and\n\ne toissue an Auditor's Report that includes our opinion.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in\naccordance with Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it\nexists.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error. They are considered material if, individually or in the\naggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on\nthe basis of the Financial Report.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Report is located at the\nAuditing and Assurance Standards Board website at:\nhttps://www.auasb.gov.au/admin/file/content102/c3/ar1_2020.pdf This description forms part of our\nAuditor's Report.", "caption": "the text on the page reads, ' the financial statement '"}
